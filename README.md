# CommentsClient

Description
-----------
React.js client to comments-api.azurewebsites.net. Lists comments, sends comment with a name.


Note
-----
API returns comments in a date created ascending order. The client reverses that order to see the last comment first. 


Note Two
--------
Never wrote any react.js before, but it feels inline with everything else facebook does.
